# Fix-the-Header
We are assigned a buggy header that is also not responsive, so our mission is to handle and resolve the bugs along with making it responsive for various screens so that its user friendly and ready to use.

given-header.html is the file which is given initially and contains minor bugs and is not responsive. index.html is the enhanced version making it responsive and fixing the issues trying to give it an attractive look and style.
The Resources folder contains copule of sample logos out of which we utilized one, its URL was used in the img tag and its pic in .png file is available in Resources directory so that you can locally have it also as a replacement for the URL. 

You can view the final enhanced page at https://faizan-zahid10.github.io/Fix-the-Header/
